# Pet Adoption System

This project is a microservices-based architecture for managing the pet adoption system. It consists of independent services, each responsible for a specific part of the process. The system was developed using Spring Boot and utilizes Eureka and API Gateway.

## Project Structure

### 1. Eureka
Eureka is used for service discovery, allowing microservices to locate and communicate with each other dynamically. The service registry is hosted at `http://localhost:8761/eureka/`.

### 2. API Gateway
The API Gateway manages incoming requests and handles JWT authentication. It validates user credentials, routes requests to the appropriate microservices (such as Pet Service and User Service), and enforces authorization on configured routes.

- **JWT Validation**: The API Gateway validates JWT tokens to ensure requests are authenticated.
- **Routing**: It directs requests to the correct microservices based on the URL path.

### 3. User Service
The User Service handles user registration and login. It validates the user's identity and issues a JWT token, which is used for authentication in other services.

### 4. Pet Service
This service is responsible for managing pets and their adoptions. The main functionalities include:

- CRUD operations for pets (create, read, update, delete).
- Adoption process: When a pet is adopted, the system updates the pet's status, assigns the owner, sets the adoption timestamp, and publishes an event to a RabbitMQ queue for further processing by other services.

### 5. Notification Service
This service is responsible for notifying users when an adoption is completed. It listens to a RabbitMQ queue for adoption events, and upon receiving a message, it sends a confirmation email to the adopter informing them that the process has been successfully finalized. 

### 6. Database
Most microservices have their own dedicated databases to ensure separation of concerns and data encapsulation:

- **Pet Service**: Maintains a database with all information related to pets and their adoption status.
- **User Service**: Contains a database with user registration and authentication details.
- **Notification Service**: This service does not require a database, as it operates solely based on messages received through RabbitMQ.

## Next Steps

### 1. Monitoring with Prometheus + Grafana
We will integrate Prometheus to collect metrics about the performance of microservices and Grafana to create monitoring dashboards that help identify bottlenecks, failures, and understand the overall system behavior. With this setup, you will get real-time insights into the status of your microservices.

## How to Run the Project

### Prerequisites
- Docker

### Step-by-Step
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project root.
2. Run docker compose up --build -d to start all containers.
3. Wait until all services are up and running.
4. The application is now ready to use.

‚ö†Ô∏è If you're using an Apple Silicon (M1/M2) or any ARM64 architecture, MailHog may fail to start. To fix it, add platform: linux/amd64 to the MailHog service in docker-compose.yml.

üí° A preconfigured insomnia.json file is available in the root directory. You can import it into Insomnia to easily test all available routes across the microservices.

## Technologies Used
- **Spring Boot**: Framework for developing microservices.
- **Spring Cloud Gateway**: Gateway for request routing and JWT validation.
- **Spring Cloud Eureka**: Service discovery for communication between microservices.
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database for storing pet and user information.
