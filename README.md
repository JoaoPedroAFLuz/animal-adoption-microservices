# Pet Adoption System

This project is a microservices-based architecture for managing the pet adoption system. It consists of independent
services, each responsible for a specific part of the process. The system was developed using Spring Boot and utilizes
Eureka, API Gateway, Prometheus, Grafana, Docker â€” and now Keycloak with OAuth 2.0 for identity and access management.

## Project Structure

### 1. Eureka

Eureka is used for service discovery, allowing microservices to locate and communicate with each other dynamically. The service registry is hosted at `http://localhost:8761/eureka/`.

### 2. API Gateway

The API Gateway manages incoming requests and handles routing. It directs requests to the appropriate microservices (
such as Pet Service) based on the URL path.

### 3. Keycloak Integration

Keycloak has replaced the previous custom User/Auth Service. It acts as a centralized identity and access management
solution:

* Microservices now authenticate using **OAuth 2.0** tokens provided by Keycloak.
* Services can retrieve user information directly from Keycloak using its admin endpoints.
* User management (registration, login, roles) is handled externally through the Keycloak UI or API.
* JWT tokens issued by Keycloak are used by the microservices to authenticate and authorize requests.

This update brings increased security, standardization, and ease of integration with external identity providers in the
future.

### 4. Pet Service

This service is responsible for managing pets and their adoptions. The main functionalities include:

* CRUD operations for pets (create, read, update, delete).
* Adoption process: When a pet is adopted, the system updates the pet's status, assigns the owner, sets the adoption
  timestamp, and publishes an event to a RabbitMQ queue for further processing by other services.
* **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: The service uses roles defined in Keycloak to enforce permissions:

  * Only users with specific roles can create, update, or delete pets.
  * Access to certain data, such as viewing adopted pets from other users, is restricted based on user roles.

### 5. Notification Service

This service is responsible for notifying users when an adoption is completed. It listens to a RabbitMQ queue for
adoption events, and upon receiving a message, it sends a confirmation email to the adopter informing them that the
process has been successfully finalized.

### 6. Prometheus

Prometheus is our monitoring system that collects and stores metrics from all microservices in real-time. Key features:

* Metrics Collection: Pulls metrics from each service's /actuator/prometheus endpoint at regular intervals
* Time-Series Database: Stores all metrics with timestamps for historical analysis
* Service Health Monitoring: Tracks request rates, response times, error rates, and system resources
* Alerting: Can trigger alerts when metrics exceed predefined thresholds

All services expose Spring Boot Actuator metrics which Prometheus scrapes every 15 seconds.

### 7. Grafana

Grafana is our visualization platform that transforms Prometheus metrics into actionable insights:

* Interactive Dashboards: Provides real-time visualizations of system performance
* Service Monitoring: Displays key metrics like API response times, JVM memory usage, and database connections
* Custom Alerts: Visual indicators when metrics cross warning/critical thresholds
* Pre-built Dashboards: Includes optimized dashboards for Spring Boot applications

The Grafana instance is preconfigured with:

* A Spring Boot monitoring dashboard (ID: 4701)
* A Microservices communication map
* JVM and database performance dashboards

### 8. Database

Most microservices have their own dedicated databases to ensure separation of concerns and data encapsulation:

* **Pet Service**: Maintains a database with all information related to pets and their adoption status.
* **Keycloak**: Uses its own database to store user credentials, roles, groups, sessions, and tokens.
* **Notification Service**: This service does not require a database, as it operates solely based on messages received
  through RabbitMQ.

## How to Run the Project

### Prerequisites

* Docker

### Step-by-Step

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project root.
2. Run `docker compose up --build -d` to start all containers.
3. Wait until all services are up and running.
4. The application is now ready to use.

ðŸ’¡ A preconfigured `insomnia.json` file is available in the root directory. You can import it into Insomnia to easily
test all available routes across the microservices.

## Technologies Used

### Core Technologies

* Spring Cloud Eureka: Service discovery for communication between microservices.
* PostgreSQL: Relational database for storing pet and user information.
* RabbitMQ: Message broker for handling adoption notifications.
* **Keycloak**: Identity and access management system.
* **OAuth 2.0**: Protocol for secure authorization between services.

### Monitoring & Observability
